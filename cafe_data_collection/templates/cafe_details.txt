Guidelines for content:
1. Ratings (all scores except Vibe must have exactly one decimal place):
   - Overall Score: Consider all aspects
   - Coffee Score: Quality, variety, and execution
   - Food Score: Quality and selection of food offerings
   - Vibe Score (integer 1-10): Overall feeling and energy
   - Atmosphere Score: Design, comfort, and ambiance
   - Service Score: Staff knowledge, friendliness, efficiency
   - Value Score: Price relative to quality and experience
   Only in cases of extreme quality should a cafe be given a 10. Expect only 1-3% of cafes to get a perfect 10.

2. Rich Text Sections:
   - Vibe Description: Paint a picture of the atmosphere and feeling (exactly 3 sentences)
   - The Story: Share background, inspiration, and significance (3-5 sentences)
   - Craft & Expertise: Detail coffee program and excellence (up to 5 sentences)
   - What Sets Them Apart: Highlight unique features (3-4 sentences)

3. Additional Information:
   - Google Maps Place ID: Search for and provide the actual ID
   - Social Media: Search for and provide actual Instagram and Facebook URLs
